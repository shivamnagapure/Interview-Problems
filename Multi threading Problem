🔹 1. Race Condition

Problem: Multiple threads update a shared resource at the same time, leading to inconsistent results.

Example: Two threads increment a counter simultaneously.

Solution: Synchronization (synchronized, Lock, AtomicInteger).

Interview Question: “How do you prevent race conditions?”

🔹 2. Deadlock

Problem: Two or more threads wait on each other’s lock → none can proceed.

Example: Thread A locks obj1 and waits for obj2, while Thread B locks obj2 and waits for obj1.

Solution: Lock ordering, timeout, or tryLock().

Interview Question: “What is deadlock and how do you avoid it?”

🔹 3. Starvation

Problem: A thread never gets CPU time/resources because higher-priority threads keep executing.

Solution: Use fair locks (ReentrantLock(true)), thread scheduling.

Interview Question: “What is starvation vs deadlock?”

🔹 4. Livelock

Problem: Threads keep changing state in response to each other but never make progress.

Example: Two people trying to pass each other in a hallway and both keep moving aside endlessly.

Solution: Add randomness, better coordination.

Interview Question: “Explain livelock with an example.”

🔹 5. Producer-Consumer Problem

Classic interview coding problem.

Multiple producers put data into a buffer, consumers take it out.

Challenges: Synchronization, avoiding race condition, avoiding deadlock.

Solution: wait() / notify(), BlockingQueue.

Interview Question: “Implement producer-consumer in Java.”

🔹 6. Reader-Writer Problem

Problem: Multiple readers can read simultaneously, but only one writer should write (exclusive).

Solution: Read-Write locks (ReentrantReadWriteLock).

Interview Question: “When would you use ReadWriteLock?”

🔹 7. Visibility Problem

Problem: One thread updates a variable but others don’t see the change.

Solution: volatile, synchronized.

Interview Question: “What does volatile do?”

🔹 8. Atomicity Problem

Problem: Even simple operations like count++ are not atomic.

Solution: Synchronization, AtomicInteger.

Interview Question: “Why is i++ not thread-safe?”

🔹 9. Thread Safety

Problem: Shared mutable objects cause issues in concurrent access.

Solution: Immutable objects, synchronization, thread-safe collections (ConcurrentHashMap).

Interview Question: “What makes a class thread-safe?”

🔹 10. ExecutorService & Thread Pools

Problem: Managing thread creation/destruction manually is expensive.

Solution: Use ExecutorService, Executors.newFixedThreadPool().

Interview Question: “Difference between Executor, ExecutorService, and ForkJoinPool?”








🔹 1. Bottleneck Problem

Problem: When multiple threads depend on a single shared resource, the resource becomes a performance bottleneck.

Example: Many threads try to write to a single synchronized method or DB connection.

Solution: Reduce contention, use concurrent data structures, or increase resources (connection pool, partitioned locks).

Interview Question: “What is a bottleneck in multithreading and how do you fix it?”

🔹 2. Thread Interference

Problem: Multiple threads modify shared data, and their operations overlap incorrectly.

Example: Two threads executing i = i + 1 simultaneously.

Solution: Synchronization, atomic classes (AtomicInteger).

Interview Question: “Explain thread interference with example.”

🔹 3. Priority Inversion

Problem: A high-priority thread waits for a low-priority thread holding a lock, while medium-priority threads keep running.

Solution: Priority inheritance, proper design to avoid blocking.

Interview Question: “What is priority inversion?”

🔹 4. False Sharing

Problem: Threads on different cores update variables close in memory → cache line ping-pong → slow performance.

Solution: Padding/aligning variables to different cache lines.

Interview Question: “What is false sharing in multithreading?”

🔹 5. Thread Leakage

Problem: Threads are created but never terminated → resource leakage.

Solution: Use thread pools instead of manually creating threads.

Interview Question: “How do you prevent thread leakage?”

🔹 6. Deadlock Detection & Recovery

Problem: Beyond deadlock prevention, how to detect and recover if deadlock occurs.

Solution: Timeout locks, deadlock detection algorithms, resource ordering.

Interview Question: “How would you detect and recover from deadlock?”

🔹 7. Thread Pool Starvation / Thread Starvation in Pools

Problem: A fixed-size thread pool where all threads are blocked → new tasks cannot execute.

Solution: Proper sizing of pool, avoid blocking tasks in pool threads.

Interview Question: “What problems can happen in a fixed thread pool?”

🔹 8. Concurrency Bugs in Collections

Problem: Using non-thread-safe collections (like ArrayList, HashMap) in multiple threads.

Solution: Use Collections.synchronizedList() or ConcurrentHashMap.

Interview Question: “Difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap in multithreading?”

🔹 9. Blocking vs Non-blocking Synchronization

Problem: Threads blocked waiting for locks can reduce throughput.

Solution: Use non-blocking structures (Atomic classes, StampedLock).

Interview Question: “Explain non-blocking concurrency.”

🔹 10. Livelock vs Starvation vs Deadlock (Advanced)

Problem: Subtle differences between these three, often confused.

Solution: Understand causes:

Deadlock → circular waiting.

Starvation → low priority or unfair locks.

Livelock → threads actively doing work but not progressing.

Interview Question: “Explain livelock with example.”
